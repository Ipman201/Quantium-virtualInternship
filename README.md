# Quantium-virtualInternship

## Task 1 - Data preparation and Customer Analytics
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate
insights and provide commercial recommendations.
Background information for the task
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the
upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing
trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour.
Consider what metrics would help describe the customers' purchasing behaviour.
Main goals of this task are :
1. Examine transaction data - check for missing data, anomalies, outliers and clean them
2. Examine customer data - similar to above transaction data
3. Data analysis and customer segments - create charts and graphs, note trends and insights
4. Deep dive into customer segments - determine which segments should be targetted

## Task 2 - Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the impact of the trial
store layouts on customer sales.
Background Information for the task
Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.
This can be broken down by:
1. total sales revenue
2. total number of customers
3. average number of transactions per customer

## Task 3 - Analytics and Commercial Application
* Use your analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
Background Information for the task
* With our project coming to an end its time for us to send a report to Julia, based on our analytics from the
previous tasks. We want to provide her with insights and recommendations that she can use when developing
the strategic plan for the next half year.
* As best practice at Quantium, we like to use the "Pyramid Principles" framework when putting together a report
for our clients. If you are not already familiar with this framework you can find quick introductions on by
searching form them on the internet.
* For this report, we need to include data visualisations, key callouts, insights as well as recommendations and/or
next steps.
* We recommend you use a tool like PowerPoint (or similar) to create your report.
Main goals of the task are:
1. Data literacy level of your audience
2. Table of contents / agenda
3. Problem statement / purpose
4. Overview and context
5. Content balance
6. Layout and content display
