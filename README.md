## Task 1 - Data preparation and Customer Analytics
Conducted analysis on client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate
insights and provide commercial recommendations.
Background information for the task
We need to present a strategic recommendation to Julia that is supported by data which she can then use for the
upcoming category review however to do so we need to analyse the data to understand the current purchasing
trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour.
Main goals of this task are :
1. Examine transaction data - check for missing data, anomalies, outliers and clean them
2. Examine customer data - similar to above transaction data
3. Data analysis and customer segments - create charts and graphs, note trends and insights
4. Deep dive into customer segments - determine which segments should be targetted

## Task 2 - Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Extend analysis from Task 1 to help identify benchmark stores that allowed to test the impact of the trial
store layouts on customer sales.
Background Information for the task
Julia has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.
This can be broken down by:
1. total sales revenue
2. total number of customers
3. average number of transactions per customer

next steps.
